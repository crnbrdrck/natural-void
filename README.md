A podcast site made specifically for the ExVo D&amp;D games.

That being said, I'll be making it as easy as possible for others to use so feel free :)

Made with Go, Bulma, TypeScript and &lt;3

PS I know the code is kinda messy (looking at you `routes.go`) but I'll be cleaning up after the thing is finished I promise.
