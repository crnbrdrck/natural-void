# natural-void
A podcast site made specifically for the ExVo D&amp;D games.

That being said, I'll be making it as easy as possible for others to use so feel free :)

Made with Go, Bulma, Vue.js and &lt;3

## Colour Schemes
I want to update the colour schemes to match the scheme of the Chapter that the party are on.

I come up with 2-tone colour schemes for each Chapter, plug those into https://colormind.io and keep generating ones until I get a nice one.

- Dread
  - B9ADA9
  - 656993
  - 2C0047  # Main Purple
  - 660000  # Main Red
  - 1A141D

# Wavelength for player
The wavelength player tool is provided by https://www.npmjs.com/package/waveplayer. This will also be styled using the main colours of the theme.
